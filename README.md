# DC-Mini-Project
# 🚀 Optimized CRC for Error Detection in High-Speed Networks

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on optimizing **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC-32)** algorithms for error detection in **high-speed networks**. It implements **CRC-32 in CSMA Ethernet Protocol** using **lookup table (LUT)-based optimization** and compares its efficiency with traditional CRC implementations. The project is simulated using **NS-3** with error injection and detection mechanisms.

## 🏗 Features  
✅ **Optimized CRC-32 computation** using LUT  
✅ **Bit error injection** for real-world simulation  
✅ **Packet transmission over CSMA Ethernet**  
✅ **Error detection with CRC validation**  
✅ **Performance analysis with Wireshark packet inspection and NetAnim Animation**
